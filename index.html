                            <p>Web Usability is an important thing to consider and be knowledgable about when creating a website.
                                You want to think to yourself as a user when designing a website and go, "What would look good here? Does
                                this feel good to navigate around?". You also want to use techniques for styles of websites. For example
                                a blog website will usually have 1 image accompanying a body of text for an entry. A wiki website will
                                have a decent amount of images, and some hyperlink references for you to check out. You want to use
                                multimedia elements when creating your website to make it feel alive. Some of these elements are text,images,
                                videos, and more. The colour and size of your text and / or buttons are very important! Small sized text can be
                                very hard to read, small sized buttons can cause miss clicks.</p>

                            <p>Images in multimedia are very important. As they are one of the core aspects of multimedia. They can assist
                                web users to visually acknowledge something and convey a message. As the popular saying goes, "A picture
                                is worth a thousand words". In multimedia there are 2 main types of images, BitMaps / raster images which is 
                                what is shown to the left, and vector drawn graphics. If the image shown was a vector drawn graphics I could 
                                stretch it to any resolution I wished and it would stay the same quality. But since it is a raster image the quality
                                becomes lower if I change the resolution because raster images are a grid of pixels and dots making up the image. The
                                program has to try its best to fill in the gaps when stretched to a higher resolution to make it look somewhat the original.
                                Vector drawn graphics are those that are drawn in illustration programs such as adobe illustrator, they are usually drawn
                                by an artist rather than an image taken by a camera. Because the vector drawn graphic is an original, it can be stretched 
                                to any resolution or shortened down. Vector images also take up much less space than compared to raster graphic images. Cartoons,
                                anime, symbols, etc are usually vector drawn graphics. On the downside vector images cannot be used for photorealistic images, and 
                                sometimes may require a plugin to support web-based display. There is also a third wildcard category: 3-D images. These are 3 dimensional
                                rendered and / or animated drawings. Usually video games support 3-D animations for character sprites, such as the Unreal Engine, or other
                                various game engines. The features of 3-D modeling are: modeling, extruding, and lathing. Modeling is placing the elements onto the 
                                3-D plane, extruding is the shape of a surface extends distance, and lathing is a profile of the shape is rotated around an axis.
                                Panorama's are images that are stitched together in a sequence to form 1 large photo.
