                            <p>Web Usability is an important thing to consider and be knowledgable about when creating a website.
                                You want to think to yourself as a user when designing a website and go, "What would look good here? Does
                                this feel good to navigate around?". You also want to use techniques for styles of websites. For example
                                a blog website will usually have 1 image accompanying a body of text for an entry. A wiki website will
                                have a decent amount of images, and some hyperlink references for you to check out. You want to use
                                multimedia elements when creating your website to make it feel alive. Some of these elements are text,images,
                                videos, and more. The colour and size of your text and / or buttons are very important! Small sized text can be
                                very hard to read, small sized buttons can cause miss clicks.</p>
