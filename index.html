                            <p>Web Usability is an important thing to consider and be knowledgable about when creating a website.
                                You want to think to yourself as a user when designing a website and go, "What would look good here? Does
                                this feel good to navigate around?". You also want to use techniques for styles of websites. For example
                                a blog website will usually have 1 image accompanying a body of text for an entry. A wiki website will
                                have a decent amount of images, and some hyperlink references for you to check out. You want to use
                                multimedia elements when creating your website to make it feel alive. Some of these elements are text,images,
                                videos, and more. The colour and size of your text and / or buttons are very important! Small sized text can be
                                very hard to read, small sized buttons can cause miss clicks.</p>

                            <p>Images in multimedia are very important. As they are one of the core aspects of multimedia. They can assist
                                web users to visually acknowledge something and convey a message. As the popular saying goes, "A picture
                                is worth a thousand words". In multimedia there are 2 main types of images, BitMaps / raster images which is 
                                what is shown to the left, and vector drawn graphics. If the image shown was a vector drawn graphics I could 
                                stretch it to any resolution I wished and it would stay the same quality. But since it is a raster image the quality
                                becomes lower if I change the resolution because raster images are a grid of pixels and dots making up the image. The
                                program has to try its best to fill in the gaps when stretched to a higher resolution to make it look somewhat the original.
                                Vector drawn graphics are those that are drawn in illustration programs such as adobe illustrator, they are usually drawn
                                by an artist rather than an image taken by a camera. Because the vector drawn graphic is an original, it can be stretched 
                                to any resolution or shortened down. Vector images also take up much less space than compared to raster graphic images. Cartoons,
                                anime, symbols, etc are usually vector drawn graphics. On the downside vector images cannot be used for photorealistic images, and 
                                sometimes may require a plugin to support web-based display. There is also a third wildcard category: 3-D images. These are 3 dimensional
                                rendered and / or animated drawings. Usually video games support 3-D animations for character sprites, such as the Unreal Engine, or other
                                various game engines. The features of 3-D modeling are: modeling, extruding, and lathing. Modeling is placing the elements onto the 
                                3-D plane, extruding is the shape of a surface extends distance, and lathing is a profile of the shape is rotated around an axis.
                                Panorama's are images that are stitched together in a sequence to form 1 large photo.

                            <p>Audio in media is also a pillar within multimedia. Sound is the vibrations in the air to create pressure
                                that are perceived as what we hear. Sound wave vary in pressure level and in frequency / pitch. The 
                                pressure level (amplitude) controls how loud it is, the frequency controls the pitch of the sound.
                                Sound pressure levels or volume is measured in decibels. Sound frequency is measured in Hertz Hz.
                                Frequency is the number of cycles per second, and wave length is the distance between any 2 points in the same
                                cycle. Humans can hear a maximum of 20,000hz and a minimum of 20hz. Ultrasonic is sound with a frequency above 
                                20,000hz and infrasonic is below 20hz. Samples represent the amplitude of sound at a discrete point of time.
                                The quality of digital recording depends on the sampling rate which is the number of samples taken per second and bit
                                depth. Bit depth is how many bits represent the value of each sample. The more often you take a sample, the more 
                                data you store about that sample, the finer the resolution and quality of the captured sound will be when it is played.
                                The quality of audio is based on the quality of the recording, not the device on which it will play on. Trimming an audio file
                                is referred to removing dead space from the front and end of an audio recording. Format conversion is converting your audio file
                                to a different file format for editing, data may be lost when converting formats. The higher the sound quality of a file, the larger
                                the size it will be. MIDI audio is a communication standard developed early 1980s for electronic musical instruments and computers.
                                It allows music and sound synthesizers from different manufacturers to communicate with each other. MIDI compared to digital audio
                                is device dependent. MIDI is the best way to create original music, but they are also smaller than digital audio files in size. MIDI
                                files are also more suited for web page embedding.
